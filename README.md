# patient-billing-automation

My mom spends 4-5 hours per month manually formatting invoices, attaching these invoices to emails, and drafting emails for her patients. This app takes in a CSV file of all her patients and automatically generates the invoices and uses the Gmail API to draft messages to her patients.

### Requirements
1. Billing CSV file columns - First Name, Last Name, Dx, Date, Location, CPT, Charge, Due/Paid
2. Email CSV - First Name, Last Name, Email
